## Exercise: Formatting text

This repo is the source code for a React app that takes a string of text and converts it into either all-lowercase or all-uppercase characters. The UI has been implemented, including some basic styling, but the functionality is only partially implememted.

![Screenshot of the text converter app, showing a textarea, some radios, amd am output region](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13525251/132274725-f689b335-d072-46b5-a471-e58447cba4f3.png)

**Your task is to write the logic that actually converts the provided text into uppercase or lowercase.** You will only need to modify `App.js` to complete this task. You may not use any third-party libraries to complete this task.

You may add tests to cover your code, but this is **completely optional**. You may use a third-party testing library of your choice to implement your tests.
### Expected behavior

If the app were given the following as input:
```
This is some text.
```
Submitting the form with the "Convert text to uppercase" radio selected should output the following:
```
THIS IS SOME TEXT.
```
Submitting the form with the "Convert text to lowercase" radio selected should output the following:
```
this is some text.
```
## How your code will be evaluated

Your code will be evaluated on three criteria:
- **Correctness:** Does it follow all the instructions?
- **Code quality:** Is it readable and well structured?
- **Idiomatic code style:** Does it follow the stylistic conventions of the language, such as indentation and capitalization?

Come to your technical interview ready to talk about this app and the code you wrote for it. Do your best, and happy coding!
